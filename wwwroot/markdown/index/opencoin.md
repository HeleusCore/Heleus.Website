## Open Coin {.h2 .primary-color}
We need a way to pay for services or transfer money in the Heleus Core
ecosystem. In an free, easy and independent way {.h5}
:::

Yes, we want to be independent. And we want simple and fast payments. And yes,
we don't want any external influence on the Heleus Core ecosystem. That's the
reason why use the **Heleus Coin** as payment method. You can easily transfer
coins from your account to another or receive payments - within a few seconds.
And for increased security, you don't pay for Heleus services directly. Heleus
Core services use, like it's common in app stores, **~~in-app~~ purchases** like
features and subscriptions. These service payments must be authorized through
the [Heleus App](/heleus). {.mb-4}
