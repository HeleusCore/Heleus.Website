## Our Apps and Services {.h1 .primary-color}
We decided to use a bottum-up approach for developing Heleus Core. That means
that while we worked on Heleus Core, we also build apps and services that
utilized Heleus Core. With this approach, we could see problems, that we
wouldn't have seen with a classic top-down approach, added features we didn't
think of before and made Heleus Core a much better and flexible product.{.h5}
