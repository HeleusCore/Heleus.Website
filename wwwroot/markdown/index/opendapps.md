Write your own dApps, or as we call it, your own Heleus service. {.h5}
:::

It is up to you, what you do with your Heleus service. Store data decentralized in an open and transparent way, use your users clients for scientific computing or something we don't think about yet. It is important for us that you have full control over your Heleus service. And we don't want you to use a specific programming language or learn other obscure techniques. The communication, the service and the data are all open and transparent to you. Use it for something awesome! {.mb-4}
