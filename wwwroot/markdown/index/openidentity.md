## Open Identity {.h2 .primary-color}
You define your identity. You decide, if you're just a bunch of anonymous bits and bytes or a real person. {.h5}
:::
We think it is important to stay anonymous, if you want. And we give you this option with Heleus. You simply register a new account with our official [Heleus App](/heleus) and you're done. There is no need to supply an email or anything else. Afterwards, you use the [Heleus App](/heleus) to authorize other Heleus apps and services. Your account is your identity, your **secure and anonymous single sign-on**. And if you don't want to stay anonymous, you can set up your own [Profile](/heleus#profile).
