## Open Data {.h2 .primary-color}
Whatever you do, you constantly create data. We need to rethink, how we handle all this data. {.h5}
:::

We distinguish between two types of data: public user-content and private user-content. We believe that the former should be available to everyone and should not be hidden in private black-boxes. The latter is usually sensitive data. It is highly encrypted and you are the only person with the key to the data. To raise the security standards, encryption and decryption is done locally only on your device and not online. There is no way anyone between can compromise this data. {.mb-4}
