## Host our Services on your own {.h1 .primary-color}
We love open standards and interoperability. Therefore, you can run your own
Heleus Service and add your custom node to our standard app. E.g. run your own
[Heleus Message](/message) node in your local or private network, add the node
to our app and you're ready done. You can run your own service, which only known
people can access. This will increase your privacy even more and you're not
forced to host your data on external servers. {.h5}
