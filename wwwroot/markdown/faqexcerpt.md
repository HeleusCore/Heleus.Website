We know that the blockchain became a buzzword in the past few years and that a
lot of people can't hear it anymore. But if you step back a bit, you see that
**the blockchain is more than just the foundation for crypto currencies**. It's a
great way to generate trust and that's what we want for Heleus Core. We use the
concepts of digital signatures and transactions to build trustworthy and open
databases.

Another advantage of the blockchain is the high degree of anonymity. You don't
need a registration with an email address or something else. All you need is
our [Heleus App](/heleus) to register an account free an easy. {.mb-8}

### How does the Blockchain work? [#](#js-scroll-to-chains) {.h3 .text-primary }

:::
Heleus Core is not just one big blockchain, there are several types of blockchains
available. All use the same Heleus Database technology, but have a different
purpose.

The **Core Chain** is one global blockchain. It contains all the account information
(like the public key, the amount of Heleus Coins), Heleus Coin transfers and
the information about all the available Heleus Services.

The **Service Chain** has a similar purpose than the Core Chain, but it is
unique for every service. It contains all the authorized accounts and all made
purchases.

The **Data Chain** is where all the service specific data is stored. Every
service can have one or more data chains. {.mb-8}
